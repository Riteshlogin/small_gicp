# small_gicp

**small_gicp** is a header-only C++ library providing efficient and parallelized algorithms for fine point cloud registration (ICP, Point-to-Plane ICP, GICP, VGICP, etc.). It is a refined and optimized version of its predecessor, [fast_gicp](https://github.com/SMRT-AIST/fast_gicp), re-written from scratch with the following features.

This repository is mostly unchanged from the original, except for a small experiment I started to see to what extent downsampling would affect the accuracy of ICP.
